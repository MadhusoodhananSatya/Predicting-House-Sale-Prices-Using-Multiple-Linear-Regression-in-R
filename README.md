üåü **Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression**

This project explores **multiple linear regression** to predict house sale prices using the **Ames Housing dataset**. It follows a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, starting with data exploration and feature selection, and moving through model building, evaluation, and refinement. The goal is to build a robust predictive model by systematically adding features and addressing common issues in regression analysis.

The analysis is conducted using **R**, leveraging key libraries like `car`, `corrplot`, and `caret`. The notebook starts by examining correlations between potential predictor variables and the target variable, `SalePrice`. It then constructs and compares several linear regression models, progressively adding features to determine which combination provides the best fit. The project also demonstrates crucial techniques for assessing model assumptions and robustness, including residual analysis, multicollinearity checks, and handling influential data points.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Details

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook begins by importing and inspecting the data, then calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix of several numerical features using `corrplot`. This helps identify which variables, like **Gr_Liv_Area** (Above-ground living area) and **Garage_Area**, have a strong relationship with **SalePrice**.

-   **Model Building and Comparison**:

    -   **Simple Linear Regression**: An initial model (`model_1`) is created with just **Gr_Liv_Area** to establish a baseline. The relationship is visualized with a scatter plot and regression line.

    -   **Multiple Linear Regression**: The analysis builds a series of models (`model_2` through `model_5`) by adding features like **Garage_Area**, **Basement_Area**, and **Age_Sold**.

    -   **Model Selection**: The models are compared using statistical tests like **ANOVA** and information criteria such as **AIC** and **BIC** to determine which model offers the best balance of simplicity and predictive power.

-   **Model Diagnostics**: The project performs several key diagnostic checks to ensure the validity of the models:

    -   **Residual Analysis**: It generates plots of residuals vs. fitted values to check for **homoscedasticity** (constant variance of errors).

    -   **Multicollinearity**: The **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** is calculated for `model_4` to detect multicollinearity, which can destabilize the model's coefficients.

    -   **Heteroscedasticity Test**: The **Breusch-Pagan test** (`bptest`) is used to formally test for non-constant error variance.

    -   **Outlier and Influential Point Detection**: **Cook's distance** is used to identify influential data points that may disproportionately affect the model's parameters.

-   **Feature Engineering**: A new feature, **Total_Sq_Ft**, is created by combining `Gr_Liv_Area`, `Basement_Area`, and `Garage_Area`. A new model (`model_6`) is built with this engineered feature to see if it improves performance.

-   **Handling Categorical Data**: The project demonstrates how to incorporate a categorical feature (`Overall_Qual`) into a linear regression model, allowing R to automatically handle the creation of dummy variables.

-   **Advanced Techniques**: The notebook includes an exploration of **Ridge Regression** using the `glmnet` package. It shows how to use cross-validation (`cv.glmnet`) to find the optimal tuning parameter (`lambda`) that balances model complexity and fit, which is particularly useful for dealing with multicollinearity.

-   **Cross-Validation**: The `caret` package is used to perform **10-fold cross-validation** on `model_4`, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project, you will need an **R** environment with the following libraries:

-   `car`

-   `corrplot`

-   `caret`

-   `carData`

-   `ggplot2`

-   `lattice`

-   `lmtest`

-   `glmnet`

You can install these packages using the `install.packages()` command within your R environment. The project also requires the `ameshousing3.csv` dataset, which should be placed in the same directory as the script.

### üìä Project Workflow

The **`week 8.R`** script follows a clear, step-by-step workflow:

1.  **Setup and Data Loading**: Necessary libraries are loaded, and the `ameshousing3.csv` dataset is read into a data frame.

2.  **Initial Data Exploration**: A reduced dataset with key numerical features is created, and a correlation plot is generated to visualize relationships between variables.

3.  **Model Iteration**: A series of linear models (`model_1` to `model_5`) are built and summarized. The `summary.lm` function is used to inspect key metrics like R-squared and p-values.

4.  **Model Comparison**: The `anova()`, `AIC()`, and `BIC()` functions are used to formally compare the models' performance and select the most parsimonious yet effective one.

5.  **Diagnostic Checks**: The script systematically checks for heteroscedasticity with residual plots and the **Breusch-Pagan test**, multicollinearity with **VIF**, and influential points with **Cook's distance**.

6.  **Feature Engineering**: A new feature (**Total_Sq_Ft**) is created and used to build `model_6` to assess if combining variables improves the model.

7.  **Advanced Modeling**: The project demonstrates the implementation of **Ridge Regression** to handle potential multicollinearity issues more robustly, showing how to find the optimal `lambda` using cross-validation.

8.  **Cross-Validation**: **10-fold cross-validation** is performed using the `caret` package to provide an unbiased estimate of the chosen model's predictive accuracy.

### üìà Final Thoughts

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating linear regression models in R. It covers not only the basic steps of model fitting but also the critical diagnostic checks that ensure a model is reliable and valid. The use of various models, feature engineering, and advanced techniques like Ridge Regression showcases a systematic and professional approach to predictive modeling.
